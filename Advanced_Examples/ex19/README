Demonstrate a compute shader with particle
Derived from Mike Bailey's compute shader example
NOTE:  I use glDispatchComputeGroupSizeARB so that I can
change the size of a group at run time.
This is not always well supported so you may need
to change this to glDispatchCompute and specify only
the number of groups and then set the group size in 
in the shader.
