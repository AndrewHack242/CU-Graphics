Andrew Hack, HW9

Time spent: 8 hours

compiling: make
running: ./hw9

----KEYBINDS

page up & page down: change dimensions of space

arrow keys: rotate Object

w/s: move object closer or farther

p: switch perspective (good for getting a look at a far away object close-up)

l: toggle lines on the object for seeing triangles

o: switch objects

m: swap between smooth lighting and non-smooth lighting on the sphere

f: shows failed geometry shader project
, and .: change LOD on failure

esc: exit program


----CODE REUSE:
Code began as ex18, also got some starter shader code from learnopengl.com

----OTHER NOTES:
I made an LOD simulator using tesselation as well as a failed attempt at a similar outcome using a geometry shader.

The geometry shader didn't work because I hit a cap on how many vertices I can make in the geometry shader... now I know.

The further away the object is, the less detail it is given, using orthogonal can allow you to watch this effect in action without it becoming very small.
PUSH W/S

I am very proud of my creation of the Torus shape, it was a bit more complex than the sphere and I'm confident I understand VAO's and tesselation shaders now.
