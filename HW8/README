----CODE REUSE:
Code began as ex16

----OTHER NOTES:
hit m to see both of my creations

Swirl: particles of random color spin around the center, falling at constant rate towards the center. 
After reaching the center, they start again at the outside. particles also fade as they approach the center

Black Hole: like swirl, but one color and particles speed up their fall as they approach the center. Also implemented a gap in the middle that renders no particles
